## Creating a new repo:
1.  `git init` <- initializing a git repository
2.  Create repo on github
3.  `git remote add origin <github http url>`
4.   to test run `git remote -v` - shows if remote repository is connected

## How to create / push commits:
1.  `git add .` - means git add everything, all saved changes
2.  `git commit -m "Commit message here"`
3.  `git push origin main/master` or `git push origin main/master -u`


*** If you use `-u` upstream flag, all subsequent/further commits you use `git push` instead of `git push origin main`


# Branching your repo:
1.  `git branch <name of new branch>` - create a new branch
2.  `git checkout` to see what branch we are on
3.  `git checkout <name of branch>` - to switch to different branch
    -   when in alternative branch all changes are saved/commited only to that branch

*** DO NOT MAKE CHANGES TO BOTH BRANCHES ***

## Git Merging:
-   Merging is the process of combining a secondary branch with the main/master branch
1.  Switch to branch you want to merge into (usually main branch)
2.  `git merge <name of branch to merge>` - combines secondary branch into main

# Git Clone:
1.  In terminal, navigate to folder you want to clone code in to.
2.  Run command, `git clone <https url from github here> opt_new_name_for_folder`

# Git Pull:
1.  In terminal, directory should be the repo you want to update
2.  Run command, `git pull`
